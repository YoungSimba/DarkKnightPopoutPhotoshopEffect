# DarkKnightPopoutPhotoshopEffect
This is a before and after of a popout picture effect that I was trying to achieve using Adobe Photoshop during my spare time when the movie first came out into theatres.  This is a very basic effect.  One of the things that I can do to improve this effect is to have the bats also popping out the of the picture.
Enjoy! #Batman #TheDarkKnight

I have also added a Lion popout effect into this repository
